## Trees - Postorder Traversal
Your task is to implement the following function :
```
void postorder(TreeNode*)
```
You will be working with the following structure :
```
struct TreeNode {
	int x;
    struct TreeNode* L;
    struct TreeNode* R;
}
```
You may only edit the BODY of the code, leaving the HEAD and the TAIL as it is.
