## Printing a Linked List
Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

__Input Format:__

The void Print(Node* head) method takes the head node of a linked list as a parameter.

Each struct Node has a val field (which stores integer data) and a next field (which points to the next element in the list).

Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Each test case calls the Print method individually and passes it the head of a list.

Note: Do not modify any part of the code except the body.

__Output Format:__ 

Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.
