##  Converting a Sequence to Another
You are given two integer sequences A and B,

Your task is to make the sequence A exactly identical to B.

You can perform three operations on the sequence A :
1. Insert an integer at some position
2. Remove an integer from some position
3.Modify an integer i.e. give a new value to an integer at some position.

Every operation takes 1 unit of cost.

Your task is, given A and B, find the minimum cost to convert A to B.

__Input Format:__

1. First line contains the number of elements in A
2. Second line contains the elements of the array A
3. Third line contains the number of elements in B
4. Fourth line contains the elements of the array B

__Output Format:__ 

Print the minimum cost of converting A to B.

__Notes__
- Size of the sequences will not exceed 1000
- All elements of the sequences fit in a 32-bit integer.
