## Binary Exponentiation
Write a program to print the value of (AB) % M, given the values of A, B and M.

Remember, those who use an O(B) function to find the value of AB are scum. But those who use the inbuilt library function to find the value of AB and then do %M are worse than scum.

__Input Format:__

Three integers, A, B and M.

__Constraints:__ 

1 <= A, B, M <= 1012

__Output Format:__ 

Output one integer denoting the value of AB % M.

__Sample Input__

2 3 3

__Sample Output__

2
